## **DAX** - Data Analysis Expressions

DAX is a library of functions and operators that can be combined to build formulas and Expressions used by Microsoft BI tools.
DAX is also known as Function language, where the full code is kept inside a function.

### **Purpose OF DAX** 
  Calculated Columns
  Measures
  Calculated tables

### **Calculated Column  VS Measure**

  ### **Calculated Column**
    Expands the Table by creating a new column
    Stored along with table, consumes memory
    Less Analytical capability

  ### **Measure**
    Summarises data into a single value
    Calculated at runtime / Stored temporarily
    Rich Analytical capability

  ### **Calculated Table**
    Date tables
    Role-playing Dimensions - Individual dimension (Date) playing a main role
    what-if-analysis
    Derived table

  ### **Operators**
    & Concatenation
    && AND Operator
    || OR Operator

  ### **Naming**
    Table Name   - Sales
    Table Name   - 'Canada Sales'
    Fully qualified column name - Sales[amount]

  ### **Data Type**
    DateTime, Date, Time
    Text
    Whole, Decimal
    Boolean

## **Row Context VS Filter Context**

    ### Row Context

      Row context calculates each row, with the values within that row.
      Profit = SUMX(Sales, [Sales Amount] - [Cost Amount])

    ### Filter Context

      Filter context is, a set of filters applied before that table arrives for use.
      Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Sales Amount])

      Applying filters from Filter Pane / Visuals / Slicers
    
  ### **Calculate**

    Evaluates an expression in a context modified by filters

    Total India Sales = Calculate(SUM(Sales),country = 'India')

    Total Sales = Calculate(SUM(Sales),ALL(country)


  ### **DAX Functions**

    Date and time functions  
    Time Intelligence functions  
    Filter functions
